# Mouse Square Movement Script

This script uses the PyAutoGUI library to create a continuous mouse movement in the shape of a square. It moves the mouse cursor to the right, down, left, and up, forming a square pattern. The script will continue to repeat this movement until it is manually stopped by the user.

## Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/whoismarios/MoveMouse.git

## Setup and Dependencies

Before you can run this script, you'll need to make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

### 1. Python

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. PyAutoGUI

This script relies on the PyAutoGUI library to control the mouse cursor. You can install it using pip, the Python package manager:

```bash
pip install pyautogui
```	

# Running the Script
Once you have Python and PyAutoGUI installed, you can run the script by following these steps:

1. Open a text editor and copy the script code into a new file, for example, script.py.

2. Save the file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt.

4. Navigate to the directory where you saved the script using the cd command. For example:

```bash
cd /MoveMouse
```

Run the script with the following command:
    
```bash
python script.py
```

The script will start moving the mouse cursor in a square pattern. To stop the script, press Ctrl + C in the terminal.

The script will continue to move the mouse cursor in a square pattern until you manually interrupt it with Ctrl + C.

### Note: 
Be cautious when running this script, as it can make your mouse cursor uncontrollable until you stop it.

Now you have successfully set up and run the Mouse Square Movement Script using Python and PyAutoGUI.
